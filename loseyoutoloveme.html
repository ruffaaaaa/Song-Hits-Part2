                            You promised the world and I fell for it<br>
                            I put you first and you adored it<br>
                            Set fires to my forest<br>
                            And you let it burn<br>
                            Sang off-key in my chorus<br>
                            'Cause it wasn't yours </p>
    
                        <p> I saw the signs and I ignored it<br>
                            Rose-colored glasses all distorted<br>
                            Set fire to my purpose<br>
                            And I let it burn<br>
                            You got off on the hurtin'<br>
                            When it wasn't yours, yeah<br>

                            I needed to lose you to find me<br>
                            This dancing was killing me softly<br>
                            I needed to hate you to love me, yeah</p>

                        <h5>
                            Meaning of the Song:
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            In “Lose You to Love Me”, Selena Gomez portrays herself
                            as being the victim of unrequited love.
                            And the addressee is indeed her boyfriend (or possibly ex).
                            Part of her beef with him is 
                            due to he apparently loving another woman more than she.
                            And this is despite him ‘promising her the world’,
                            meaning that he gave his word that he would treat Selena good.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            So the obvious implication is that this particular romance,
                            at least from Gomez’s perspective, is toxic.
                            Indeed she very much needs to get out of it,
                            for the mistreatment is having a negative effect on her self-esteem.
                            Or as the title artistically summarizes the situation.
                            a prerequisite for Selena to properly “love” herself is for her to first “lose” this partner. And considering that the album this track is featured on possesses some autobiographical elements, this may very well be the case of Miss Gomez referring to one of her real-life exes.
