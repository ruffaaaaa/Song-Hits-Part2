                    Lyrics:
                </h4>
                    <p>
                        I found a guy, told me I was a star <br>
                        He held the door held my hand in the dark <br>
                        And he's perfect on paper but he's lying to my face <br>
                        Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved? <br>
                        And there's one more boy, he's from my past <p>
                    <p> 
                        We fell in love but it didn't last <br>
                        'Cause the second I figure it out he pushes me away <br> 
                        And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway <br>
                        And I say that I'm through but this song's still for you <br>
                        All I want is love that lasts </p>

                    <p> Is all I want too much to ask? <br>
                        Is it something wrong with me? <br> 
                        All I want is a good guy <br>
                        Are my expectations far too high? <br>
                        Try my best but what can I say <br>
                        All I have is myself at the end of the day <br>
                        But shouldn't that be enough for me? <br>
                        Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh </p> 
                    <p> And I miss the days <br>
                        When I was young and naive <br>
                        I thought the perfect guy would come and find me <br>
                        Now happy ever after it don't come so easily </p> 
                    <p> All I want is love that lasts <br>
                        Is all I want too much to ask? <br>
                        Is it something wrong with me? Oh <br>
                        All I want is a good guy <br>
                        Are my expectations far too high? <br>
                        Try my best but what can I say <br>
                        All I have is myself at the end of the day <br>
                        And all I want is for that to be okay
                     </p>

                    <h5>
                        Meaning of the Song:
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Olivia Rodrigo wrote “All I Want” from the
                        perspective of a fictional character she portrays.
                        However, the reason she was able to do so effectively
                        is because its theme was personally a
                        “very-relatable concept” to her.
                        And said subject is the narrator’s discontent with two ex-boyfriends
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first boy is illustrated as a loving yet deceptive boy.
                        Then, the relationship she has had with the second boy is “unreciprocated love”.
                        Here, the singer is asserting that ‘all she wants’,
                        i.e. her only longing, is to maintain a relationship
                        that is actually long-term.
                        Therefore, the essential notion behind this track
                        is Olivia’s yearning to confront a passionate friend to grow together.
                        However, she has already realized through her past experiences,
                        that this point isn’t easy to obtain.
